<h2>Accordion Panel</h2>
<!-- Create Accordion Div -->
<div id="accordion">
	<h3 class="ac-toggle">Blade Runner 2049 </h3>
	<div class="ac-content">
		<p> 
		<em>Critics Consensus:</em> Visually stunning and narratively satisfying, Blade Runner 2049 deepens and expands its predecessor's story while standing as an impressive filmmaking achievement in its own right.
		</p>
	</div>
		
	
	
	<h3 class="ac-toggle"> 
Jigsaw </h3>
	<div class="ac-content">
		<p> 
		<em>Critics Consensus:</em> Jigsaw definitely won't win many converts to the Saw franchise, but for longtime fans, it should prove a respectably revolting -- if rarely scary -- diversion.
		</p>
	</div>
		
	
	
	
	<h3 class="ac-toggle">
STRANGER THINGS: SEASON 2 </h3>
	<div class="ac-content">
		<p> 
		<em>Critics Consensus:</em> Stranger Things' slow-building sophomore season balances moments of humor and a nostalgic sweetness against a growing horror that's all the more effective thanks to the show's full-bodied characters and evocative tone.
		</p>
	</div>
		
	
	
<h3 class="ac-toggle"> 	
THOR: RAGNAROK </h3>
	<div class="ac-content">
		<p> 
		<em>Critics Consensus:</em> Exciting, funny, and above all fun, Thor: Ragnarok is a colorful cosmic adventure that sets a new standard for its franchise -- and the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
		</p>
	</div>
		
	
	
	<h3 class="ac-toggle">
IT </h3>
	<div class="ac-content">
		<p> 
		<em>Critics Consensus:</em>  Well-acted and fiendishly frightening with an emotionally affecting story at its core, It amplifies the horror in Stephen King's classic story without losing touch with its heart.
		</p>
	</div>
